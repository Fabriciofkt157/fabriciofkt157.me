------{New World}------
[cutscene = "The End?";]

Mike: Wh...Where am I?
Mysterious Man: He finally woke up.
Mike: Wh...Who are y...you?
Mysterious Man: You must be wondering what happened.
Mysterious Man: The past you knew ceased to exist just moments ago.
Mysterious Man: The one speaking to you is the being responsible for guiding the souls of all beings that once lived in the universe.
Mike: A...Am I dead? And... Who is this guy?
Mysterious Man: Maicon Jousan, at the age of 14 years, 4 months, and 22 days, lost his life due to bleeding after an episode of violence.
Mike: ...I remember being attacked but... I think I passed out before realizing...
Mysterious Man: Alan Dount, passed away due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 17 years, 8 months, and 6 days.
Alan: ...
Mysterious Man: You are now in the valley of forgetfulness, and there is nothing that can reverse it.
Mysterious Man: What remains for you now is to follow the natural order of things. However, I propose some alternatives:
Mysterious Man: The first one, you will remain here, in the course of this river, slowly fading away and being forgotten.
Mysterious Man: The second, you will live a new life, starting over as a new person. Therefore, you will not remember who you were in the past life; this was the choice made by you previously.
Mysterious Man: The third and final alternative, you will continue from where you left off, but in an alternate reality and with a goal: to defeat the Army of Shadows whose integrity is unknown, all that is known is that it aims to take control of the entire multiverse.
Mysterious Man: In this reality, nothing of what you have seen so far will be the same - see this as a chance for a new beginning, it will be like a new life, however, your memories and personalities will remain intact.
Mysterious Man: Initially, I will grant some benefits:
Mysterious Man: You will have no difficulty communicating with the inhabitants, and you will easily be able to find housing.
Mysterious Man: Don't worry, if you die again in this reality, you can still choose one of the other alternatives.
Mysterious Man: Take all the time you need to make your decision.
Mike: I... choose the... New World...
Mysterious Man: Excellent choice! Have a good journey.
Alan: Wait... you mean... me too?
Alan: WHAT DO YOU MEAN "HAVE"? I don't...

[cutscene = "Arrival in the New World"]
Mike: ... This is...
Alan [angry]: YOU!
Alan: I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU AND YOU DRAGGED ME HERE ALONG WITH YOU!
Mike: Hey, hey, calm down...
Mike: I didn't... know that...
Alan: Did you even stop to wonder why there's a guy you've never seen before with you in who knows where we are now?
Mike: ... I didn't know this would affect both of us, and anyway, I thought if you came along, it was because you agreed to it.
Alan: "Agreed," I didn't say a word. I couldn't choose what happens to my life, not even at the end of it.
Mike: ...
Mike: Look, we... we're here, there's nothing that can be done. Anyway, when this is over, you can choose one of the other options, like that guy said.
Alan: ...
Mike: We'll have to live, whether you want to or not.
Alan: You talk as if I'm going to stick with you.
Mike: We have to defeat that army; it would be better if we were together, wouldn't it?
Alan: No chance, don't even try, each goes their own way. Get lost.
Alan: Enjoy your "new world."
Mike: Okay...
Mike: But... if you need me for anything, just... look for me.
Mike: See you around.
Alan: Get lost.

[End of cutscene, beginning of gameplay]
[Player will be playing as Mike and can explore the map, guided by some missions to gather information; the final mission will be to go to the PUB when it's 6:00 PM (time will progress until 7:00 PM, when it reaches that time, it will pause)]

[Player enters the PUB with Mike]

[Mike enters the PUB]
[Alan is seated at a table to the right near the center]
[As he walks toward a table, Mike notices Alan - Alan glances at him from the corner of his eye]
Mike:...
[Mike approaches Alan]
Mike: Alan...
Mike: Look, can we talk?
Alan: I said everyone should go their own way.
Mike: I know, I know, I just wanted to check if you're okay.
Alan:...
Mike: My bad, if I knew that...
Mike: Forget it, there's no way to justify.
Mike: I just didn't want things to be awkward between us.
Alan:...
Mike: I'll go my way, try to take care of yourself, okay?
[Mike turns around]
Alan: I'm okay, Maicon, just...
[Mike looks back at Alan]
Alan: I...
Mike: Want to talk?
Alan: No. But I'm fine.
Mike: Alright. See you around.
[Mike goes to one of the tables and stays there for a while, the screen darkens with "40 minutes have passed"]
[Mike remains at the same table]
[A guy approaches Mike]
?: Hey buddy. You okay?
Mike: Me? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just new around here.
?: Mind if I join you?
Mike: Sure, have a seat.
?: What's your name?
Mike: Mike, I'm Mike. And you?
Rit: Rit, Ritain, but I prefer to be called Rit.
Mike: Cool.
Rit: You said you're new here, where are you from?
Mike: I used to live in a village far from here. Kind of had to leave there.
Rit: Something happened?
Mike: The village was attacked, luckily I managed to get out of there.
Rit: I see. What do you think of this place?
Mike: Interesting. I've been exploring some things, don't know everything yet but from what I've seen, it's cool.
Mike: It's "different."
Rit: I guess nothing is quite the same.
Rit: Did you come here alone? You seem younger than the folks around here.
Mike: I came with a friend. But... We had a falling out earlier today and I haven't spoken to him since.
Rit: How old are you?
Mike: 14.
Rit: Damn... Well, do you have a place to stay?
Mike: Truth is, no. I arrived here today.
Rit: Look, if you want, there's a small residents' association with some houses next to the center here. Some are vacant, you could take one. That's where I live.
Rit: The association is like a partnership, in exchange for the house, you help other residents when they need it. The same goes for them. When you need it, they'll help you too.
Rit: The people there are very welcoming, I think they'll be glad to have you there.
Rit: What do you think?
Mike: Wait. Seriously?
Rit: Yes, yes.
Mike: Ah, I'm in.
Rit [smiling]: Great.
Rit: When we leave here, I'll take you there. You can move in today if you want, of course.
Mike [smiling with hand on the back of his neck]: Sure!
Mike: Have you always lived there?
Rit: No, no. I used to live with my parents in a nearby town.
Rit: But... The village where we lived was attacked, and then my uncle brought me here with my brother. Not long after, I found out my parents were killed trying to defend the village.
Mike: Wow... I... I'm sorry.
Rit: It's okay, that was a long, long time ago.
Rit: Let's talk about something happier.
Mike [smiling]: Yeah.
Mike: Do you work with something?
Rit: Me? I'm a blacksmith, but since the shadow attack, I've been serving in the army. They needed more people, so I decided to go.
Mike: I see.
Mike: I wanted... to join too.
Rit: You just need to go to the Combat Center, I'll take you there tomorrow if you want.
Mike: Sounds good.
Rit: I'm not sure if they'll let you in because you're too young, but we'll go anyway. Maybe they won't mind.
Mike [smiling]: Yeah.
Rit [rubbing the back of his neck]: ... Here, take this, it's a map... You'll need it...
Mike [smiling]: Oh, thanks!
[game shows the map]
Rit: We're here [arrow pointing to the Pub on the map]
Rit: Here's the association [arrow pointing]
Rit: Here's the center [arrow pointing to the Combat Center]
Mike: Okay, I think I got it...
Rit: It's getting kind of late... Wanna go check out the place?
Mike: Ah... yeah. Let's go.
[Player will leave the PUB with Mike and follow Rit to the house]

Rit: Here it is.
Mike: ... ... Here? ...
Rit: Do you like it?
Mike [very impressed]: All of this for me? ...
Rit: Yes.
Mike: It's huge.
Mike: It's amazing.
Rit: I'm glad you like it.
Rit: You'll sleep here...
Mike: Don't I need to sign something? Or say that I'm here?
Rit: Technically, I live here. There's a list of residents, I signed it for this one.
Rit: Tomorrow we'll transfer it to you, and then I'll show you around the association.
Mike: Okay.
Rit: Well... That's it...
Rit: See you tomorrow, okay?
Mike: Okay.

[time = 9 PM]

[end of cutscene, player can explore the house and its surroundings, along with some functionalities; ref = "mechanics.txt" #"buildings/Mike's house"]

[Player can explore the house and surroundings until 11 PM. Mike will occasionally mention that he should go to bed (every hour):
parallel dialogues {
    #1[9 PM]: Mike: I think I should go to bed.
    #2[10 PM]: Mike: Hm, it's going to take a while for me to get used to this place, better go to sleep.
    #3[11 PM]: Mike: Okay, that's enough. I'm going to sleep. [screen darkens with the message: "Mike went to bed"]
    [After Mike goes to bed (regardless of the time), the story will continue]

[Loading screen with the message: "Screwed and Friendless"]

[Active character = Alan]

[Alan slept in a cave and didn't discover anything particularly relevant]
[Alan is at the entrance of the cave with the camera pointing outside]
[Player can walk with Alan and explore the area]

parallel dialogues {
    Alan: Damn, slept so poorly.
    Alan: "Easy living": a cave in the middle of nowhere.
    Alan: Still gotta survive in this damn new world.
    Alan: Can't even cease to exist. There's always some idiot messing things up.
    Alan: Damn it! This sucks.
    Alan: Should find something useful to do.
    Alan: Put this map to use.
    [interface showing how the map works]
    Alan: Maybe gather some information, or... fix up this place...
    [camera points towards the direction of the city {
      Alan: The city is in that direction.
    }]
}
[player controls Alan, can choose to go to the city or stay and explore the area until 6 PM. When it's 6 PM {
  Alan: Alright, I guess that's it for here. I'll see what I can get at the center.
  [player can go or not to the PUB (controlling Alan there), reaching at most 9 PM {

    If it exceeds this time, hours will progress until 1 AM {
      Alan: Enough, I'm going to sleep.

      parallel dialogues {
        Alan: Looks like the Pub is one of the places to get information.
        Alan: Maybe I should join that idiot.
        Alan: No, no chance.
        Alan: He's right. I won't last long here. Not alone.
        Alan: Forget it, I'll keep to myself and try something.
        Alan: I'll go to that tavern, maybe I'll find someone dumb enough to help me. Or at least, find out where things I need are located.
      }
      [When player reaches the PUB: cutscene = "Followers of an idiot"]
      ?: Hey! Would you happen to know a place to spend the night around here?
      Alan: Sorry, I'm new here too...
      ?: I see, thanks anyway.
      Alan: I'm kind of... Sleepy.
      Alan: Makes sense, haven't eaten anything in a good while.
      Alan: [Checks pockets] Yeah, no luck.
      Alan: Apparently people here are money-crazy.
      Alan: Seriously... Expected... to find things to eat around, but...
      Alan: I'll have to figure out a way to get money.
      Alan: Steal? No chance, people kill for way less than that. Not keen on dying, not again. 
      [muffled voices]
      Alan: Oh, that's just great.
      Alan: Looks like the "smart guy" found others like him.
      Alan: And if I went there to talk to him? No chance.
      Alan: Dam...
      [Camera blurs and Alan faints]
      [Alan opens his eyes, camera blurry]
      Mike: Alan? Alan, are you okay?
      [Alan squints and stares at Mike]
      Alan: Do I look okay to you?
      Mike: ...
      Mike: Is there anything I can do?
      Alan: Could've just left me there.
      Mike: ...
      Mike: Come on. I'll take you home. [Mike holds Alan's arm]
      Alan: You don't have to, Maicon. I'll manage.
      Mike: Yes, I do. You're not okay.
      Alan: Obviously not... Just leave me alone, okay?
      Mike: ... Fine ... Just ...

          Alan: Could've just left me there.

Rit (smirking): Don't worry, it's just a training.
Rit: How about a bet?
Mike: What do you mean?
Rit: If I win, tonight's drinks at the Pub are on you. If you win...
